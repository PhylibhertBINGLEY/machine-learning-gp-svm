# Machine Learning : Gaussian Process & SVM
This repository is a school homework I did in my machine learning classes. The project has two parts : one to study the Gaussian Process, and the other for SVM.

1) Implementing and applying Gaussian Process regression to predict the distribution of a function.
2) Using SVM models to tackle classification on images of hand-written digits (from 0 to 4).
